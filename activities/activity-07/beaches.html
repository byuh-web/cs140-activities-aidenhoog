            <p>
                Waimea Bay is a wide, <span id="emphasize">beautiful beach</span> with a deep blue bay. In summer it can be calm for swimming and snorkeling. In winter the waves can get powerful and the surf is world-famous.

                Sunset Beach
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sunset Beach has a long shoreline and great views at the end of the day. Winter swells can bring big surf, and calmer seasons are perfect for walks and relaxing by the water.

                Pipeline
            </h3>
            <p>
                Pipeline is one of the most famous surf breaks in the world. Waves break over a shallow reef and form fast barrels. It’s a popular place to watch experienced surfers from the sand.
