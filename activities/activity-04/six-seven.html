    <h2>What is Six Seven?</h2>
    <p>“Six seven” is a phrase that has been trending on TikTok and other social media platforms among tweens and teens. It’s often used in videos where the creator talks about something confusing or nonsensical, sometimes paired with humorous or exaggerated reactions.</p>
    <p>Six seven (or 67 or 6 7, etc.) is a nonsensical expression used especially by teens and tweens that is connected to a rap song and also to a 6’ 7” tall basketball player.<br><br>
    Teens and adults alike have tried to explain it. Some say it means “so-so,” especially since kids often pair the phrase with an up-and-down hand motion. Others argue it refers to a person who is tall, some think it stands for a basketball term, and so on. The bottom line is, the term “six seven” is nonsensical—which is sort of the point. As one tween TikToker put it under another video,<p id="targetParagraph">“I think the point is that it makes no sense.”</p>
